cleo (yuekai) miao is a chinese artist currently based in boston, MA. 

she plays with both the poetics and the absurdity of digital tools and culture and works to make sense of identities and bodies in virtual spaces. 

cleo’s work considers the reality that is configured and mediated by images. Technology forces us to rethink the presence (or absence) of the self in virtual spaces. It augments and modifies our perception and understanding of the world around us and therefore becomes an extension of our physical bodies. Images of the self captured with cameras and 3d scanners made presentable first for the screens eventually become a way of self-inspection. As we try to recreate and translate our reality, the digital inserts itself and creates a new system of intimacy. Through playful investigation, cleo questions and spectates the role and affect of photographic images and mediums.
